# GliGli's TileMotion video codec

This project achieved its goal: to find a novel way to **compress an entire video** (as a whole) so that the **decoder is computationally cheap** and **trivially simple to write**.

So far, the **encoder** is mostly FreePascal code with some x64 SSE3 assembler (additional libraries and tools being mostly C/C++) and has a GUI to showcase it.

The **reference decoder** is written entirely in *javascript* and uses *HTML5 Canvas* to decode, proving that minimal code and computing power is necessary.

Upon bitstream format maturity I will probably write a DirectShow plugin or something akin.

The project is in **Alpha stage** and located at: <https://github.com/gligli/tiler>

## Encoder steps description:

- Load:
  * Using FFMPEG, extract frames PNGs.
  * Find keyframes start points using Pearson correlations from frame to frame.
  * Build a tileset for the whole video and simple 1:1 tilemaps.

- Dither:
  * Apply "K Means" clustering on a psychovisual descriptive model on the tiles of a keyframe to prepare splitting them into tile palettes.
  * Use "Dennis Lee v3" or custom "Value At Risk" quantizer to extract tile palettes for each previously computed tile cluster.
  * Use "Thomas Knoll pattern-based" or "Yiluoma 2" dithering to make truecolor tiles into palettized tiles, selecting the best palette using the PsyV model.

- MakeUnique:
  * Simple prepass for the global tiling to merge strictly similar tiles together.

- GlobalTiling:
  * Use KModes clustering on the tiles indexes to globally reduce tile count (about 1% left after that), using the centroids as new tiles.
  * Remap tiles from the frames tilemaps to the reduced tiles.
  * Output TileSet (GTS) as file for potential reuse on another video (TODO: only write the tiles references in the final bitstream GTM file).

- FrameTiling:
  * Using "K Nearest Neighbors" on the psychovisual descriptive model of tiles in all H/V mirroring positions, find the best tile for a given frame tilemap position.

- Reindex:
  * Prune now unused tiles from the global tileset, packing it.
  * Sort remaining global tiles by use count, so that the first tiles in the tileset are more likely to be used compared to the rest.
  * Remap tiles from the frames tilemaps, accounting for the sorting.

- Smooth:
  * Use the PsyV model to merge tiles from frame to frame at the same screen position, so that the "Save" step can safely skip them inside a keyframe.

- Save:
  * Describe the tiles / tileset format as a binary command stream, using "zone" skip commands to try to pack it.
  * Save key frames as self-contained LZMA2 streams into the final TileMotion (GTM) video stream.
